# File and Folder Structure in Linux

In Linux, everything is treated as a file even if it is a normal file, a directory, or even a device such as a printer or keyboard. All the directories and files are stored under one root directory which is represented by a forward slash /.

The Linux directory layout follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). This standard defines how directories are organized and what types of files should be stored in each. Since Linux is based on UNIX, it inherits many of its filesystem conventions. Similar directory structures can also be found in other UNIX-like operating systems such as BSD and macOS. Understanding the Linux directory structure is essential for efficient system administration, file management, and problem-solving.
