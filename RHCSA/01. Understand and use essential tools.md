# Understand and use essential tools

## 01 Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax

TThe **shell** is a program that interprets your commands and sends them to the Linux kernel.

Think of it as your **personal translator** between you (human) and Linux (machine).

- Default shell in RHEL = **`bash`** (Bourne Again Shell)
- Other shells: `sh`, `zsh`, `dash`, `fish`, etc.

ðŸ§ª Check which shell you're using:
```bash
echo $SHELL
