# Linux Architecture

## Overview

Linux operates using a layered architecture that separates user operations from critical system functions, ensuring both performance and security. 

Each layer plays a unique role in managing resources, executing processes, and interfacing with hardware.

## Layered Architecture table

| Layer | Description |
|----------|----------|
| 🧑‍💻 **User Applications** | Programs running in user space (e.g., vim, curl, docker, firefox) |
| 💻 **Shell / CLI**    | Command interpreter for user interaction (e.g., bash, zsh) |
| 📚 **System Libraries** |  Provide APIs to applications, wrap system calls (e.g., glibc, OpenSSL) |
| 👤 **System Services / Daemons**  | Background processes managed by the init system (e.g., sshd, cron, journald)|
| 🧰 **System Call Interface (SCI)**  | Bridge between user space and kernel |
| 🧠 **Linux Kernel** | Manages processes, memory, filesystems, devices, etc. |
| ⚙️ **Hardware** | CPU, RAM, Storage, Network, Peripherals |

### Breakdown

👤 User Applications

- These are the programs the end-user interacts with directly. 
- They live entirely in user space and rely on system libraries and the kernel to perform I/O, memory allocation, etc.
- Examples: vim, curl, docker, firefox
- Cannot directly access hardware or kernel memory

---

💻 Shell / CLI

- The shell is a command-line interpreter that parses user input and interacts with the kernel via system libraries.
- Examples: bash, zsh, fish
- Supports scripting, job control, piping, redirection

---

📚 System Libraries

- These provide standard interfaces for applications to perform system-level operations without accessing the kernel directly.
- Examples: glibc, libm, OpenSSL
- Wraps syscalls like open(), read(), fork()

---

🔧 System Services / Daemons

- These are background processes typically managed by systemd or other init systems. 
- They perform essential functions like networking, logging, and scheduling.
- Examples: sshd, cron, rsyslogd, NetworkManager
- Start at boot and run persistently in the background

---

🔁 System Call Interface (SCI)

- Acts as the secure bridge between user space and kernel space.
- Applications request kernel functions via syscalls (e.g., read(), write())
- The kernel validates and executes those requests

---

🧠 Linux Kernel

- The core of the operating system, running in Ring 0 (privileged mode).
- Manages process scheduling, memory allocation, device I/O, filesystems, and networking
- Handles inter-process communication, kernel modules, and interrupt handling

----

⚙️ Hardware

- Includes all physical components:
- CPU, RAM, storage devices (HDD, SSD), network interfaces, USB peripherals
- The kernel interacts with hardware through device drivers

## 🛡️ Why This Architecture Matters

- 🔒 **Security:** Isolates apps from direct hardware access  
- ⚙️ **Modularity:** Each component is loosely coupled  
- ⚡ **Efficiency:** Processes only get what they need with minimal overhead  
- 💡 **Debuggability:** Makes system troubleshooting easier
