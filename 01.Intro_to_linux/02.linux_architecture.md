# Linux Architecture

## Overview




| Architecture | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| 🧑‍💻 User Applications | Programs running in user space (e.g., vim, curl, docker, firefox) |
| 💻 Shell / CLI    | Command interpreter for user interaction (e.g., bash, zsh) |
| 📚 System Libraries |  Provide APIs to applications, wrap system calls (e.g., glibc, OpenSSL) |
| 👤 System Services / Daemons  | Background processes managed by the init system (e.g., sshd, cron, journald)|
| 🧰 System Call Interface (SCI)  | Bridge between user space and kernel |
| 🧠 Linux Kernel | Manages processes, memory, filesystems, devices, etc. |
| ⚙️ Hardware | CPU, RAM, Storage, Network, Peripherals |
